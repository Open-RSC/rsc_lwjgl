TODO List:
* Maps are flipped? https://prnt.sc/113y2xz
* Diagonal walls aren't constructed properly.
* Tile heights dont seem to be severe enough to look authentic. Turn down the bilinear interpolation dividers?
* Tile3D->groundOverlay is using VectorObjects temporarily; this needs to be removed and replaced with triangles that actually match RSC ground overlays... Maybe the Tile3D class could store each of the 2 triangles as objects, and the ground overlay could override the tile color.
* Tile3D->wall that equals a door, should be an empty (pink placeholder) space; and a Door class object would be constructed in it's place.
* GameConfigs.TERRAIN_BRIGHTNESS_MODIFIER not implemented in roofs, walls, or models yet.
* Load placeholder "GameObjects" (static props) into the world. If coordinates work, load the actual .obj models.

Future List:
* Tile textures (not authentic): Implement real tile textures based on color values, ie: more yellow = sand, more brown = dirt, more green = grass, and then apply a brightness modifier based on the black values from the TileColor rgb codes.
* Verify the sprite and animation data from the RSC-Remastered code. If it's all there, and it's all usable, then we will create a test entity and attach it to the camera x/y at tile height.
	* If the first test works, then we can implement a Mob class and spawn a some client-sided NPCs using the OpenRSC server NPC spawn configuration data.
	* Mob visibility distance. How far away can you see an NPC, or player?

Diagonal Wall Details:
the pattern usually follows: x, x, x, 12000 + x
this is the only tile property that is stored as an int
that's because diagonalWall can be either the forward diagonal or the reverse diagonal
forward diagonal /
reverse diagonal \
but it is stored directly in diagonalWall regardless of what type it is
so the forward diagonals usually match whatever int the north/east wall template is
and the reverse diagonal is that + 12000
